Sales is relatively equally distributed between $25 and $350 million across all promotions.
In the data visualization, TV has the strongest linear relationship with sales. Radio and sales appear to have a moderate linear relationship, but there is larger variance than between TV and sales. Social media and sales appear to have a weak linear relationship.
When TV is used as the independent variable, the R-squared for the simple linear regression model estimating sales is 0.999.
When TV is used as the independent variable, the coefficient for the intercept is -0.1263 and the coefficient for TV is 3.5614.
When TV is used as the independent variable, the slope of the coefficient for TV has a p-value of 0.000 and a 95% confidence interval of [3.558, 3.565].

Among TV, social media, and radio, TV had the strongest positive linear relationship with sales.
The linear regression model estimates that 99.9% of the variation in sales is explained by the TV promotional budget. In other words, nearly all of the variation in sales can be explained by the TV promotional budget alone, making TV an excellent predictor of sales.
According to the model, when TV is used as the independent variable X, an increase of one million dollars for the TV promotional budget would result in an estimated 3.5614 million more dollars in sales.
The interval (3.558 million, 3.565 million) has a 95% probability of containing the true estimate of the increase in sales for a one million dollar increase in the TV promotional budget. Therefore, the estimate provided in the previous bullet is very confident.
